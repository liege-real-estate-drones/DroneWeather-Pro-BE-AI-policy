    <h1>DroneWeather Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: June 6, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to DroneWeather, a web application designed for drone pilots in Belgium, offering detailed weather information and real-time flight safety assessment, integrated with regulated UAV zone data. This Privacy Policy describes how DroneWeather collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our application. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>DroneWeather collects the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> When you use the application, we collect precise location data via your device's geolocation service (if you use the "Locate Me" feature) or when you click on the map or search for an address. This information is used to:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide relevant weather information for the selected location.</li>
                <li>Display regulated UAV zones around your location.</li>
                <li>Obtain the terrain elevation at the selected point.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> We store your preferences locally on your device (via browser local storage), such as the default drone profile, default location, and UAV zone altitude filter. This data is not sent to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Usage Data (non-personal):</strong> We use standard web analytics tools (Google Analytics if enabled) to collect non-identifiable information about app usage (e.g., browser type, operating system, pages visited). This data is aggregated and anonymous and is used to improve performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The collected information is used exclusively to provide the application's services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To display weather conditions and forecasts for your chosen location.</li>
        <li>To assess drone flight safety based on weather conditions and UAV zone regulations.</li>
        <li>To personalize your user experience by saving your preferences.</li>
        <li>For internal analysis and application improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. Your location data is used only for requests to third-party services necessary for the application's operation.</p>
    <p>Your information is shared with the following third-party services, only to the extent necessary to provide the application's functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Maps Platform:</strong> For mapping, geocoding, places, and elevation services (Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API, Elevation API). Google has its own privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo & OpenWeatherMap API:</strong> For fetching weather data.</li>
        <li><strong>ArcGIS FeatureServer (Skeyes):</strong> For regulated UAV zone data in Belgium.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini (via Genkit AI):</strong> For flight safety assessment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is entirely secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. These include the right to access, rectify, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
    <p>Given that DroneWeather minimizes the collection of personal data and does not store it on its own servers beyond what is strictly necessary for real-time API requests, the exercise of these rights is primarily related to your control over data on your own device (e.g., clearing browser data) and the privacy policies of third-party services.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
